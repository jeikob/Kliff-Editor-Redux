# Kliff-Redux
**Kliff Redux is a text editor that was developed using Electron and Monaco. It was first developed as a project at the Big Red Hacks 2018 Hackathon at Cornell University. It's meant to be a simple editor which uses the same text input as Visual Studio Code, but without too many extra features so it's cleaner and simpler. The goal is to achieve a good user experience with a simple text editor that has the capability of using Vim Keybindings, and not too many extra frills.**

**Very much still a work in progress.**
